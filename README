BBB: stands for BigBuckBunny
ED: stands for ElephantsDream

*The source of the data and MPD files can be found here: http://ftp.itec.aau.at/datasets/DASHDataset2014/
*Segment sizes of the largest bitrate for BBB and ED (4sec duration) can be found here:
*BBB: http://ftp.itec.aau.at/datasets/DASHDataset2014/BigBuckBunny/4sec/bunny_3936261bps/
*ED: http://ftp.itec.aau.at/datasets/DASHDataset2014/ElephantsDream/4sec/ed_4066615bps/

In each BBB and ED directory, there are four sub-directories with the number (1clients,3clients, 5client, 10clients) of the clients that has been considered for the experiment, which has three
further sub-directories for car, ferry and train.

In each traffic patterns sub-directory, there are other items that have been explain below:

	*vlues.csv include the models and metrics value for each window
	(RF1 and SD1 are implemented with set1 of parameters and SD2 and RF2 are implemented with set2 of parameters)
	*sizes.csv represents max, min and average for each window.
	*Sub-directories with numbers, the numbers are related to each client involved in the experiment (e.g., BBB\car\1 belongs to the first client for traffic shape
	car in the BBB dataset). In each numbered directory there are other items:
	*There is a log file belongs to the related client which is the output of the simulation python code that has been run over the GENI
	test bed.
	*There is a csv file with the same name as log file that has the list of the bitrates in each window (each row is a window for the related
	client that includes a list of segment bitrates).
